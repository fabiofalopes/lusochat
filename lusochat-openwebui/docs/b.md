## CI/CD Platform Options

**Top Recommended Platforms (2025):**

**GitHub Actions** - Still the leading choice for projects already on GitHub, with excellent Docker ecosystem integration and built-in secret management

**GitLab CI/CD** - Comprehensive platform that combines version control, issue tracking, code review, and pipelines in one tool

**Alternative Options**: CircleCI, Jenkins, Azure Pipelines, and Spacelift

**Recommendation**: Stick with **GitHub Actions** for your use case since you're already using GitHub repositories, and it has excellent Docker Hub integration.

## Docker Image Validation & Testing Technologies

**Container Structure Testing:**
**Google Container Structure Test** - Tool specifically designed to validate the structure of container images

**Security Scanning:**
**Docker Scout** - Built into Docker Hub and CLI, provides vulnerability insights with zero learning curve if you know Docker

**Other Container Scanning Tools**: Trivy, Clair, Snyk, Anchore - for comprehensive security vulnerability analysis

**Smoke Testing Approaches:**
**Custom Smoke Testing** - Simple HTTP health checks using curl, combined with application-specific validation scripts

**Advanced Testing**: Postman/Newman for API testing, or custom test containers for specific functionality validation

## Deployment Automation Technologies

**Webhook-Based Deployment:**
**Docker Hub Webhooks** - Native webhook functionality to trigger deployments when images are pushed

**Webhook Listeners**: Various lightweight webhook services (docker-deploy-webhook, micro-dockerhub-hook) to receive Docker Hub notifications and trigger deployments

**Container Update Automation:**
- **Watchtower** - Automatically updates running containers when new images are available
- **Diun** - Docker Image Update Notifier for monitoring and updating containers
- **Portainer** - Container management platform with update automation features
