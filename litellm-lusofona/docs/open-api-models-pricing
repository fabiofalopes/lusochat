For faster processing of API requests, try the [priority processing service tier](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/priority-processing). For lower prices with higher latency, try the [flex processing tier](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/flex-processing).

Large numbers of API requests which are not time-sensitive can use the [Batch API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/batch) for additional savings as well.

Tokens used for model grading in reinforcement fine-tuning are billed at that model's per-token rate. Inference discounts are available if you enable data sharing when creating the fine-tune job.

### Built-in tools

| Tool | Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Code Interpreter | $0.03 / container |
| File search storage | $0.10 / GB per day (1GB free) |
| File search tool call   Responses API only | $2.50 / 2k calls |
| Web search preview (gpt-4o, gpt-4.1, gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4.1-mini) \[1\] | $25.00 / 1k calls |
| Web search preview (gpt-5, o-series) \[1\] | $10.00 / 1k calls |
| Web search (all models) \[1\] | $10.00 / 1k calls |

The tokens used for built-in tools are billed at the chosen model's per-token rates. GB refers to binary gigabytes of storage (also known as gibibyte), where 1GB is 2^30 bytes.

**Web search content tokens:**Search content tokens are the tokens retrieved from the search index and fed to the model alongside your prompt to generate an answer. Search content tokens are billed at the model’s text token rates unless noted otherwise.

\[1\] When using the `web_search` tool, pricing is $10.00 / 1k calls and search content tokens are billed at the model’s text token rates. For gpt-4o-mini and gpt-4.1-mini with `web_search`, a default of 8,000 search content tokens are billed at the model’s input text token rates. For gpt-4o and gpt-4.1 models using `web_search_preview`, search content tokens are free. The billing dashboard and invoices will report these line items as “web search tool calls.”
